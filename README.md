**Author:** Jois Prabhanjan

I had a great time completing this challenge and I hope to be part of the further rounds. This project is built using **React.js**.

## Project Overview

This is a dashboard design assignment built using **React**. The project demonstrates:

- Responsive dashboard layout
- Left and right sidebars
- Interactive components with dynamic data
- Dark and light theme support
- Redux for state management
- Ant Design and React Icons for UI elements
- Unit and integration tests using React Testing Library, Jest, and Vitest

I have followed the Figma design closely and implemented components such as:

- **RightBar**
- **LeftBar**
- **Orders Page**
- **Default Landing Page**

## Additional Features Implemented

- Storing **Favorites**
- Refreshing data on click
- Toggle of **Left and Right sidebars**
- **Splitters** and **draggable containers** in RightBar
- "Coming Soon" page with minimal animations
